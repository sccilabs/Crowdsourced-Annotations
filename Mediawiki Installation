I have completed  installation of  Mediawiki in my linux system.But before installing Mediawiki I have installed LAMP[~Linux Apache MySQL PHP ]. The order I followed is Apache, MYSQL and PHP. 
  And then from mediawiki.org  I dowloaded the zipped file(Tar Archieve) containing wiki package using wget command in Linux.Then I copied it to /var/www/html/  and then extracted it using tar command.I renamed it in as mediawiki.
  Then in the browser I navigated to localhost/mediawiki. There I followed the link Set up Mediawiki and proceeded with filling the forms as directed.In the process when I have to choose  among various databases I have choosen MySQL as it was already installed in my system.After Completing the setup procedure I got a file by name localSettings.php that has Database settings,MySQL specific settings..and many more in it.The process is successful with the main page having "Mediawiki has been installed" appearing on it.
