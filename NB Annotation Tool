It is an in place social annotation tool which can be adopted to create a better learning environment.The primary goal of NB is to facilitate collaborative Learning ,enthusiastic participation,involved discussions and thereby enable better understanding of the subject content among its users.
	 
	 Discussions about a topic  can be made more effective if they are done in the same frame of reference of the document. In NB the inplace display of comments along the margins would draw student's(user's) attention to relevant comments while reading, and encourage them to respond.This would draw more student involvement and participation ,thus providing more helpful material for other students, which  motivates them to participate more and learn more .The annotations are expected to be primarily about the subject content in the document.Students can actively  participate in questioning,interpreting and exchanging their views with other users therby understanding the concept clearly ,with a large number of questions by students answered by other students. Students using NB can appreciate the fact that they could read, comment, and reply all at the same time, and get clarification on confusing points in the Document in a timely fashion.They can also gothrough the annotations that others users have created, which appear  on the right side panel thus get most of  their doubts clarified while reading itself.Letting readers comment without leaving the reading environment  keeps the readers in the flow of their work, rather than interrupting it. 

	Pointing to  someplace in the document pops up the annotations present in that part of the document. To add an annotation somewhere in the document, users can  select a region they want to comment on and post their comment there when the annotation editor pops up. Users can tag each other’s comments like agree, disagree and Reply requested and so on.Comments can be  used to tag a section in the text with labels such as  “like” and  “dislike”.The physical layout of the annotations reveals  parts of the text that the users should stress upon for better understanding. Heavily annotated regions shows where lots of confusion is present among other users.
