I have completed  installation of  Mediawiki in my linux system.
But before installing Mediawiki I have installed LAMP[~Linux Apache MySQL PHP ]. 
The order I followed is Apache, MYSQL and PHP. 
And then from mediawiki.org I dowloaded the zipped file(Tar Archieve) containing wiki package.
Then I copied it to /var/www/html/  and  extracted it .
I renamed it in as mediawiki. 
Then in the browser I navigated to localhost/mediawiki. 
There I followed the link Set up Mediawiki and proceeded with filling the forms as directed.
In the process when I have to choose  among various databases I have choosen MySQL as it was already installed in my system.
After Completing the setup procedure I got a file by name localSettings.php that has Databasesettings,MySQL specific settings..and many more in it.
The process is successful with the main page having "Mediawiki has been installed" appearing on it.
